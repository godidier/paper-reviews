\subsection*{Summary}
The need for conversational agents have proved to be a necessity in the 
travelling business especially for venue recommendation. Building appropriate 
conversational agent models is still a challenge. On one hand existing models 
are generaly neural conversational models that use an end to end approach. 
Such models are good at capturing the local structure of word sequence 
but faces difficulty in remembering the global semantic structure of a 
dialog session. On the other hand, Methods for venue recommendation show
limitation from their reliance on the exact match of constraints which is 
sensitive to language variation, weak relationship models between venues 
and the inability to backpropagate error signals from the end output to 
the raw input.

This study proposes a Deep Conversational Recommender System that is able to 
differentiate topics in travel conversation by leveraging...
