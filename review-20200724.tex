Matching User with Item Set: Collaborative Bundle Recommendation with Deep 
Attention Network. 
Proceedings of the Twenty-Eighth International Joint Conference on Artificial 
Intelligence.

\subsection*{Summary}
Most recommendation mechanism focus on recommending a single item, while 
many real world scenarios such as travel package, music playlist, furniture, 
etc. will benefit from bundle recommendation.\\
Efficiently recommending a set of items comes with its own challenges including
the fact that bundles cannot be considered like atomic units, thus requiring 
an efficient way to embbed the bundle; and also that user-bundle 
interactions are more sparse, thus finding an efficient way to handle those 
sparse interactions.\\

The proposed model named Deep Attentive Multitask (DAM) was design to tackle 
the above mentionned difficulties. This is achieved with a factorized attention
network (an adaptive weighting sum operation) for a bundle representation 
learning, and a joint modeling of user-bundle and user-item interactions, by 
sharing the information learned from the user-item interactions in the two 
tasks of user-bundle prediction and user-item prediction.

Experiments were ran using datasets from the Netease Cloud Music where users 
can build lists of songs, and the Youshu book review site where users can build
lists of books.\\
The experiments aimed at answering the following questions: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Can the proposed DAM outperform the state-of-the-art bundle 
recommendation models?
\item How is the effectiveness of factorized attention network? 
Can it perform better than the other aggregation strategies?
\item Can multi-tast learning framework improve DAM's performance? How does the number of shared layer affect the model performance?
\end{enumerate}

To the first question, the DAM proved to outperform the state-of-the-art 
bundle recommendation models while compared to BPR (a basic pairwise ranking
algorithm), Neural Collaborative Filtering (NFC), Bundle Ranking (BR) and 
Embeddeing Factorization Machine (EFM).\\
To the second question, the factorized attention approach achieve the best performance  when compared to minPooling, maxPooling, meanPooling and a neural 
attention mechanism.\\
To the third question, sharing the layers for the different tasks prove to be 
effective up to 2 layers over 3 hidden layers.\\

The proposed model is a deep attentive multitask model for bundle 
recommendation. It uses factorized attention network to aggregate the item 
information of each bundle, a multi-task network to share knowledge of 
both user-item and user-bundle embbedings, and shared layers to enchance 
the recommendation performance. The model prove its superior effectiveness 
compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Future works include modelin the item co-occurence infoemation and realizing 
the bundle with temporal dynamics.

\subsection*{Comments}
The paper address a useful task (items bundle recommendation) that is 
seldomly approach in the popular field of recommendation systems. 
The authors make use of many of the recent deep learning  techniques in their 
models such as  \textit{multi-task learning} by training a 
model that is able to learn from user-item interactions and user-bundle 
interactions, while using an \textit{attention based learning} mechanism. 

The study is presented in an easy to reproduce way. Most steps, from the 
dataset acquisition to experiment results are clearly detailed. That include 
the network model parameters and hyperparameters, how the input vector 
was setup, the choice of a specific loss function (Bayesian Personalized 
Ranking loss), etc.\\

Regarding our research, this paper give a concrete example of building an 
item-set recommendation system. Though the bundle are predefined we may 
think of an extension of this work by building \textbf{a recommendation 
mechanism for a set of items where the bundle is build during the 
recommendation process}, using a graph learning model.\\
The paper also have some interesting pointers on deep learning for 
recommendation systems including one with graph learing models.
