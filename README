* Make a summary outline with your own words

## Comment 

* What does the article set out to do?  
* What is the theoretical framework or assumptions? 
* Are the central concepts clearly defined? 
* How adequate is the evidence? 
* How does the article fit into the literature and field? 
* Does it advance the knowledge of the subject? 
* How clear is the author's writing?

* Support your critique with evidence from the article or other texts.
* The summary portion is very important for your critique. You must make the author's argument clear in the summary section for your evaluation to make sense.[13]
* Remember, this is not where you say if you liked the article or not. You are assessing the significance and relevance of the article.[14]
* Use a topic sentence and supportive arguments for each opinion. For example, you might address a particular strength in the first sentence of the opinion section, followed by several sentences elaborating on the significance of the point.
* Also discuss the applicability
